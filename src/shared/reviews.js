        text: "I really thought I'd like this but even my not fussy husband said it was just ok. The chicken was tender and the sauce reduced nicely still it seemed to be missing something though we couldn't figure out what. Not sure what I'd add but until I figure that out I'm not likely to make this again as we have other chicken recipes we really enjoy.",
